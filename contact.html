            <h1>Web Development Process</h1>
            <p>I like to start out simple. Pencil and paper. I sketch a few rough draft ideas out and get a plan
                together.</p>
            <p>Next, I use digital media (Adobe XD, InVision,Sketch) to start creating wireframes and Mockups to get a full visual of how the
                application will look in it's finished form.</p>
            <p>After that I create some user flow diagrams to show how the user will navigate through the application.</p>
            <p>I then choose which languages to use for the best experience and start building the application.
                </p>
                <p> I always build responsive websites with mobile design first and add media queries for desktop. </p>
                <p>I believe in building each application to the client's desires so it is important for me to meet/discuss
                    the project and provide updates throughout. </p>

            <h1>Art Process</h1>
            <p>First, I have a discussion with the client to understand what the goal is for the project.
            </p>
            <p> Then I start sketching with old school pencil and sketch paper. </p>
            <p>Next , depending on the medium and project, I will add styles using ink , charcoal or digital media. </p>
            <p>No matter the size of the project I believe in treating it with passion</p>
